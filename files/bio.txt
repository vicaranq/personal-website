Hi! 

Thank you for visiting. My name is Victor Arango-Quiroga and this is my personal website. 

### Origin:
I am from Cali, Colombia where I studied at ICESI university. I moved to Boston, MA in 2014 where I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I graduated and moved to Michigan for work in 2018.
Three years later and during the pandemic, I moved back to Boston where I am currently living. 

### Interests:

My field of interest is artificial intelligence (AI). From my research experience, I am very interested in robotics and how one could control robot's behavior using code. From my online classes and professional career, I am very interested in AI and how it can solve a diverse set of problem in real life. My ultimate interest is to gain expertise in ways that AI can be used in robotics to perform challenging tasks. 
During my research and professional experience, I have been exposed and worked on natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (deep learning/NN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, XGBoost, and others), and AI in general (search, path planning, markov decision problems). 
I also have substantial experience productionalizing ML applications (MLops) which is my current focus. These experiences motivate me to continue exploring and deepen my knowledge in AI and how it integrates with robotics. 

### Education: 

I graduated as a Computer Engineer from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 2018. I am currently pursuing a [Stanford Professional Certificate in Artificial Intelligence](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program)
where I am taking three courses:

1. [Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques XCS221 ](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs221-artificial-intelligence-principles-and-techniques)
2. [Natural Language Understanding XCS224U](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs224u-natural-language-understanding)
3. [Machine Learning XCS229](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs229-machine-learning)

### Work Experience

I joined Ford Motor Company in July 2018 through the Ford College Graduate program which consists of three rotations during a time of three years (in my case, 3 and a half years). 

At Ford, I experienced how machine learning (ML) is used in marketing to make product recommendations and send targeted communications to improve sales and customer experience. I also conducted research on Fintech, including ML, to democratize AI development in the company. As such, I explored AI-as-a-service technologies and created internal publications on how to integrate trained ML models to applications that satisfied company security protocols and that could be integrated to the company's cloud platform. Now, I have been working in different use cases developing scalable AI-based solutions covering regression, classification, clustering, and natural language processing. Thus, I experienced how AI could adapt to different real-world problems.  The demand for internal AI-consulting in the company has exponentially grown in the last few years. As such, I have had the opportunity to be a Tech Lead for one of the new teams that the company is creating to accelerate the production of AI-based solutions. In this position, I am responsible for the technical implementation of the AI-based solutions of my team as well as planning and managing resources to achieve company goals.


### Research internships:

I had the opportunity of participating in two summer research internships at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu) (RPI) and at [Universidad del Valle](https://www.univalle.edu.co/). At RPI, I 
worked, under the supervision of [Dr. John Wen](https://faculty.rpi.edu/node/35995), on a vision-based autonomous vehicle project where the research purpose was to find how light settings may influence the
vehicle's behavior. As such, I integrated the hardware and software components of the robot (Duckiebot), created replicable procedures to assemble new robots, and evaluated their
performance under different light spectrums. I also improved the robot’s computer vision (CV) capabilities to perform new navigation and behavioral planning functionalities. This experience
motivated me to intern at Universidad del Valle, where I worked, under the supervision of [Dr. Bladimir Bacca](https://eiee.univalle.edu.co/eval-bladimir-bacca-cortes), on another vision-based autonomous vehicle project. Here, the research focus
was on multi-goal path planning systems for intelligent service robots in office-like environments. After reviewing papers on projective transformations and topological mapping, I
developed a program to create a topological map based on a video and another program to predict the vehicle’s location using visual information. (see my resume below for more info)
