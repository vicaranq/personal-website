Hi! 

Thank you for visiting. My name is Victor and this is my personal website. 

### Brief personal story:
I am originally from Cali, Colombia. In 2014, I moved to Boston, MA where I learned English through an ESL program at the University of Massachusetts Boston and later transferred my studies from Colombia to the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I graduated as a computer engineer in 2018 and moved to Dearborn, Michigan for work that same year.
Three years later and during the pandemic, I moved back to Boston. In 2022, I moved to San Diego, CA to pursue my Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. 


### Interests:

My field of interest is artificial intelligence (AI), specially machine learning (ML). From my research experience, I am interested in robotics and how one could control robot's 
behavior as a response of its environment (e.g. through visual or sound information). From my online classes and professional career, I am very interested in ML and Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) and how they can solve a diverse set of problems in real life. 

During my research and professional experience, I have been exposed and worked on NLP, ML (deep learning/NN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, XGBoost, and others), and AI in general (search, path planning, markov decision problems). 
I also have substantial experience productionalizing ML applications (MLops) and have delivered 20+ ML/NLP projects during my time at Ford Motor Company. 

 These experiences motivate me to continue exploring and deepen my knowledge in AI and how it integrates with real life.

### Work Experience

I am currently working (while studying) as a Graduate Advocate at [PATHS program](https://paths.ucsd.edu/about/meet-the-staff.html#Student-Staff) in UC San Diego. I assist, lead, guide, tutor, and engage with PATHS 
scholars who are completing their bacherlors degree. All the scholars that I guide are in STEM, specifically in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Engineering. My goal is to share
my experience with them and help them succeed during their academic and professional career. 

Prior to starting my MS program, I joined Ford Motor Company in July 2018 through the Ford College Graduate program which consists of three rotations during a time of three years (in my case, 3 and a half years). I rolled off the program 
in 2021 and joined the MLOps team as Tech Lead. I was selected to be part of a program for Ford employees called High Tech High Demand (HTHD). 

At Ford, I experienced how machine learning (ML) is used in marketing to make product recommendations and send targeted communications to improve sales and customer experience. I also conducted research on Fintech, 
including ML, to democratize AI development in the company. As such, I explored AI-as-a-service technologies and created internal publications on how to integrate trained ML models to applications that satisfied 
company security protocols and that could be integrated to the company's cloud platform. In 2021 and 2022, I worked in different use cases developing scalable AI-based solutions covering regression, classification, 
clustering, and natural language processing. Thus, I experienced how AI could adapt to different real-world problems. The demand for internal AI-consulting in the company has exponentially grown in the last few 
years. As such, I had the opportunity to be a Tech Lead for one of the new teams that the company is created to accelerate the production of AI-based solutions. In this position, I was responsible for the 
technical implementation of the AI-based solutions of my team as well as planning and managing resources to achieve company goals.

I left Ford Motor Company at the end of August 2022 to start my M.S. in Computer Science program at UC San Diego as a full-time student.

### Research internships:

I had the opportunity of participating in two summer research internships at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu) (RPI) and at [Universidad del Valle](https://www.univalle.edu.co/). At RPI, I 
worked, under the supervision of [Dr. John Wen](https://faculty.rpi.edu/node/35995), on a vision-based autonomous vehicle project where the research purpose was to find how light settings may influence the
vehicle's behavior. As such, I integrated the hardware and software components of the robot (Duckiebot), created replicable procedures to assemble new robots, and evaluated their
performance under different light spectrums. I also improved the robot’s computer vision (CV) capabilities to perform new navigation and behavioral planning functionalities. This experience
motivated me to intern at Universidad del Valle, where I worked, under the supervision of [Dr. Bladimir Bacca](https://eiee.univalle.edu.co/eval-bladimir-bacca-cortes), on another vision-based autonomous vehicle project. Here, the research focus
was on multi-goal path planning systems for intelligent service robots in office-like environments. After reviewing papers on projective transformations and topological mapping, I
developed a program to create a topological map based on a video and another program to predict the vehicle’s location using visual information.
